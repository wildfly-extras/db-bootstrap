Wildfly Database bootstrap extension
=========================================

This wildfly extension enables support for bootstrapping a database under the deployment startup process.
The extension allow a list of scan elements pointing to a specific EAR/JAR file containing the classes
for bootstrapping database. This will be executed before the deployment of EAR/WAR/JAR files and will allow
to bootstrap a database before the application is deployed and started.

The bootstrap process is divided into two phases. In the first phase the database schema is created. In the second
phase the database schema is updated (by running any update scripts if needed). 

This extension is currently aimed at Hibernate users. But it can also be used without Hibernate (although you won't get automatic database connectivity etc).

Prerequisite
---------------
JDK 7
Maven 3.1.1

Build the module
---------------

For building the module it's require maven 3.x or later.

To build, run the following Maven command from the parent project folder:
> mvn clean install

For running Arquillian integration test, run the following Maven command from the parent project folder:
> mvn clean verify -P arquillian-wildfly-managed 

To automatic install to existing WildFly
----------------------------------------
From the parent project directory run:
> mvn clean install -Pupdate-as -Dwildfly.home=/path/to/as8

The -Dwildfly.home is not necessary if $JBOSS_HOME is already pointing at your WildFly installation.

after install is done you can run WildFly with SDD subsystem by running:

> ./standalone.sh -c standalone-db-bootstrap.xml

To manual install to existing WildFly run
--------------------------------------------
To manual install the db_bootstrap follow the instructions

- Create a new directory under wildfly home "modules/org/wildfly/extras/db_bootstrap/main/"
- Download the latest [module.xml](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/db-bootstrap/tree/master/integrate/src/main/resources/modules/org/wildfly/extras/db_bootstrap/main) from github and place it under "modules/org/wildfly/extras/db_bootstrap/main/"
- Download the latest [releases](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/db-bootstrap/releases) and place it under "modules/org/wildfly/extras/db_bootstrap/main/". 
- Add this `<extension module="org.wildfly.extras.db_bootstrap"/>` under the `<extensions>` block to your server configuration standalone.xml / domain.xml to enable the db_bootstrap module
- Next step is to configure the module

Configure the module
--------------------
For bootstrapping the deployment use the following example of a configuration, and add it to the your jboss configuration standalone.xml or domain.xml.

	<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:db_bootstrap:1.0">
		<bootstrap-deployments name="myDeployments">
			<scan name="myScan1" filename="bootstrap_test.ear" filter-on-name="bootstrap*.jar" />
			<scan name="myScan2" filename="bootstrap_test-no-hibernate.ear" />
		</bootstrap-deployments>
	</subsystem>

You can add multiple EAR files you want to scan for `@BootstrapDatabase` annotated classes. For each EAR file, add a separate `<scan>` element.

The `<bootstrap-deployments>` element and the `<scan>` element(s) must contain an attribute `name`, which can contain any name you like (the value is currently not used for anything by db-bootstrap).

The attribute `filename` is required on `<scan>` element(s), and must contain the name of the deployed archive, that you want to scan.

The attribute `filter-on-name` is optional, and is used to specify which archives you want to scan (for classes annotated with `@BootstrapDatabase`). The attribute can use `*` as wildcard, e.g. use `filter-on-name="tada*/*.jar"`. Separate multiple paths by comma (`,`), e.g. `filter-on-name="first.jar, second.jar"`.    

Add db_bootstrap as dependency to your project
----------------------------------------------
To use db_bootstrap in your code you will need to add a Maven dependency to your project. Insert the following in your pom.xml file

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.wildfly.extras.db_bootstrap</groupId>
        <artifactId>db-bootstrap</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.7</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

User guide
-------------------
To bootstrap a database, create a class and annotate it with @BootstrapDatabase. This annotation requires one mandatory attribute:
- hibernateCfg - a String pointing to a Hibernate configuration file in the module classpath

It accepts two optional attributes:
- priority - an integer primitive that can be used to assign a priority to the bootstrap class (might be useful in case of multiple annotated @BootstrapDatabase classes)
- name - a String that gives the bootstrap class a logical name. This name can be used in combination with system properties to define hibernate configuration properties - or to override those already defined in the Hibernate configuration file (referenced by the hibernateCfg attribute).

There is one additional requirement to your bootstrap class: Add a method annotated with @BootstrapSchema or @UpdateSchema. Or add both methods. The @BootstrapSchema and @UpdateSchema annotations gives your methods a certain semantic bootstrap meaning with respect to the bootstrapping process. The bootstrapping process is composed of two phases: 
- Phase 1: All @BootstrapSchema methods are invoked (in prioritized order, according to @BootstrapDatabase.priority)
- Phase 2: All @UpdateSchema methods are invoked (in prioritized order, according to @BootstrapDatabase.priority)

It is in these methods that you should implement functionality to respectively create a new schema or update an existing schema. You could actually create the schema in the @UpdateSchema method - the extension doesn't really care. But lets just say that it isn't what this extension is designed for. 

Declare a Hibernate Session parameter in these methods and the extension will inject a Session object for you - connected to the database using the information you have provided in the Hibernate configuration document. If you don't declare a Hibernate Session parameter, then it is your methods own responsibility to create a database connection.

Example code
-------------------

    @BootstrapDatabase( hibernateCfg="hibernate.cfg.xml", priority=99, name="mybootstrapper" )
    public class BootstrapImpl {

        @BootstrapSchema
        private void doBootstrap(Session session) throws SQLException {
            // Create your database schema using the 'session' parameter
        }
    
        @UpdateSchema
        private void doUpgrade(Session session) throws SQLException {
            // Upgrade or update your database using the 'session' parameter
        }
    }

Firstly assume that this class is part of your enterprise application archive (EAR module). 

The @BootstrapDatabase annotation is what makes this a special class that will have the opportunity to run some code way before the application is fully deployed and started. 
Notice that we declare a reference to a Hibernate configuration document called "hibernate.cfg.xml" - that document contains the information necessary for  connecting to the database. 
It's just an ordinary Hibernate configuration file that is used by the extension to initialize a Hibernate SessionFactory object and Hibernate Session object.

The priority attribute has a value of 99 - so this bootstrapper class will run before classes with a lower priority. 

The bootstrapper is also given a name: mybootstrapper.
Having this name opens up the possibility for overriding hibernate properties in the Hibernate configuration file by using system properties. You can also define new Hibernate properties by means of system properties. For this to work, the system properties must have the following format:
- dbbootstrap.[boostrapper.name].[hibernate.property]

So in this example we could define the following system property to override the "hibernate.connection.url" property from the Hibernate configuration file:
- dbbootstrap.mybootstrapper.hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/importantdb

Just add it to your JAVA_OPTS environment variable or define it in the standalone.xml / domain.xml configuration file. 


Detailed trace
-------------------
Declare a logger with the name "org.jboss.as.extension.db_bootstrap" in standalone.xml or domain.xml. That will give you detailed insight into the extension's actions.
